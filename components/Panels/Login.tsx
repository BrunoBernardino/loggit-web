            Loggit is a simple and <strong>encrypted</strong> event management
            app. You can{' '}

            You have a <strong>30-day free trial</strong> (no credit card
            required), and at the end, you can pay <strong>€18 / year</strong>,

            Note that logging in will take up a few seconds. This is
            intentional, in order to generate a safer assymetric encryption key.
            After logging in, the app should be blazing fast in any device.
